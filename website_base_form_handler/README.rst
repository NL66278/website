General support for programming website forms
=============================================

This module provides a base framework for handling website Forms. It contains
all the logic of loading data, displaying a form, validating submitted data,
redisplay on errors, going to a next step on success.

Programmers of website forms can, with this module, concentrate on that
which is specific for their form, and not on the always repeating boilerplate
code.

While the name website_form_handler would be most appropiate for this module,
this might cause confusion with te existing website_form* modules, that are
basically an enduser tool.
